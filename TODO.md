## LICENCE


TODO
- multiple keys...
- some constants for keys? SPACE, SHIFT
- key should also take keycodes
- onKeyPress Vs. onKeyUp and onKeyDown
- consider using jquery . would be easier to do tons of stuff. (however vanilla has been fun)
- scrape a domain, remove common words leaving only a domain specific keyword lexicon, build a map for that lexicon (crude auto typenav generator)
- arrow up and down search results


## PLUGIN

	TODO - plugin to have it in chrome so hold key and letter jumps to favourite sites

	- typenavs for different websites. google, facebook. work on a 3 letter string to not clash with existing potential shortcuts

	- tool for users to add their own websites to typenav
	- scrape sites to detect if common pages exist and build a typenav for them
	- the plugin would detect if you were on a page and if it had a typenav registered and apply it to the page.

	navigating large websites by typing
